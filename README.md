# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-Project

In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of festive sales data to uncover business-driven insights and demonstrate how data can guide strategic decision-making.

**Project Workflow**

Data Collection: Kaggle dataset (raw festive sales data)

Data Preparation: Data cleaning, null-value handling, standardization, and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) to explore purchase patterns

Data Visualization: Built dynamic charts using Matplotlib & Seaborn for clear insights

Business Insights: Identified customer demographics, buying behavior, and product demand

**Key Findings**

Customer Demographics: Majority of buyers are females aged 26–35

Regional Trends: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka had the highest sales

Category Insights: Food, Clothing & Apparel, Electronics, and Footwear dominated purchases

Low-Demand Areas: Office supplies, veterinary, and tools categories showed minimal sales
